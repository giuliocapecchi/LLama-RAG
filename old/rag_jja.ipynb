Taken from his work \"Discipline and Punish\" , modelled on the principle of and related to the nation state, and ideally employed on the idea of an incarceration system producing society's need for prisons, it employs physical boundaries to gain control of urban space. Foucault was referring to the Mettray Penal Colony when he introduced a possible socio-cultural nomenclature to be used, \"It was the most famous of a whole series of institutions which, well beyond the frontiers of criminal law, constituted what one might call the carceral archipelago.\"\n",
